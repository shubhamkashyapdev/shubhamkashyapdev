I am a full stack javascript developer located in Chandigarh, India. I currenlty work for Equartis Technologies as a Senior Developer, located in Chandigarh, India. I am experienced in developing full stack application with MERN stack technology.

I wanted to build out some features that i would use on daily basis. Instead of creating a seperate application for those i decided to create a portfolio where i can implement all those features.

I had the inspiration from [theodorusclarence](https://theodorusclarence.com)'s portfolio website.

# Features

- Portfolio Homepage
- Payload CMS for backend
- Dedicated Project Module
- Resources / Source Code & Snippets library
- Website & Admin Templates
